Kako elektronski mediji razbacuju aktuelnosti sa svetske političke scene! Čak će i nama koji drndamo sa video igrama sam kraj novembra biti naporan, budući da nas očekuje dva bitna događaja iz te oblasti (Unity Meetup included, kek). <br>Mora da postoji neki bar polurealan razlog zašto je gotivno stripati gomilu&nbsp; dešavanja u sred jeseni... (Planiranje budžeta za kulturu za 2017. na osnovu podataka o posećenosti kulturnim događajima u proteklih godinu dana odakle se vidi da nas kultura apsolutno ne interesuje, ali pošto su puštali ljude za džabe da prave šutke na Jazz festivalu i harvestuju karte za Aca Lukas &amp; Folk house band ispada da smo poprilično aktivni delovatelji srpskoga kulturnoga miljeJa?)<\/p>\n<p>Sava centar je imao Iana Gilana, Arena će siroma' uskoro morati da pregrmi Džibonija i Bregu (obojicu čak TRIPUT), ali sa druge strane Save ICT HUB će biti domaćin još jednom Unity susretu i ovoga puta ugostiti jedan mali studio iz Beograda!<\/p>\n<p>Radi se o Color Blind Studios ekipi. Ovaj tim oformljen je u maju 2016. sa ciljem da prave igre za mobilne uređaje, prvenstveno iOS. U samom razvoju igara učestvuje troje ljudi, smešteni na Čukaričkoj padini blizu Ade Ciganlije, gde svi zajedno rade. Ime studija je odabrano zbog toga što su dva od tri člana tima - daltonisti! <br><\/p>\n<p>Prvi uspeh ostvarili su igrom \"Nukleus\", koja je izabrana za featured app na App Store-u u 139 zemalja, uključujući SAD, Kanadu i Australiju. Do sada, igra je sakupila preko 180,000 preuzimanja! <br>Sledeća igra, \"Jump or Stay\", izlazi početkom decembra, u saradnji sa Umbrella games. <br>Igra \"Kiss Hero\", koja je trenutno i dalje u razvoju, donela im je priliku da se predstave na Casual Connect-u u Tel Avivu. <br>Pa i pored svega toga, imaju još prototipa spremnih za razvoj. <br>Momci kažu da ne planiraju uskoro da prestanu sa radom. <br><\/p>\n<p>Zvuči dobro? Svratite da upoznamo ovu eksplozivnu trojku i pokušamo da provalimo kako su u roku od šest meseci ostvarili značajne uspehe.<\/p>\n<p>I da! Nije loše napomenuti: Ukoliko imate potrebu da objavite nešto na Unity susretu, samo pecnite organizatore (Milana Jerkovića ili Aleksandra Manju) i dogovorićemo se. Na prošlom susretu smo imali čak četiri poziva za posao!<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Vidimo se uskoro! <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>PS Često dobijamo pitanja u vezi sa prevozom. Ako dolazite kolima, adresa je Veljka Dugoševića 54.

Videćete kapiju i rampu sa desne strane, sa recepcijskom kućicom i tu uđite. Na recepciji kažete da idete u ICT Hub.<\/p>\n<p>Linija 66 - Kreće od Vukovog spomenika. Najbolje je da je sačekate na stanici u Ruzveltovoj i idete skroz do kraja jer ona vozi baš do Naučno Tehnološkog Parka.

Last year, our Grand Canyon workshop filled up less than two weeks after it was announced!&nbsp;These trips are very popular and only a limited number of people are allowed to go down the Grand Canyon each year.

This is a very mild time of the year, so it should be nice and warm, but not too hot. Although it rarely gets over 100 degrees at this time of the year, a quick dip in the water will cool you off. The large, motorized J-rig rafts are very safe and roomy (we will have 18 passengers and 2 crew people). There are about 60 white water rapids on this 188-mile stretch of the Colorado. You have the option of staying fairly dry in the back of the raft, or getting wet in the front. All your meals are prepared for you (the food is amazing), and all your camping equipment is provided (cots, tents, sleeping bags, chairs and a water-resistant bag to place your camera and other personals). There is some hiking involved (but rarely more that a mile), and this is optional. All transportation and transfers from Las Vegas to and from the river are provided.<\/p> \n<p><i>The photography workshop<\/i> portion covers general nature and landscape photography with emphasis on starry night photography, also known as wide-field astrophotography or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/ironrodart\/albums\/72157627607005290\">NightScapes<\/a>. Participants should already have some standard camera skills, i.e. how to take a correct exposures, and know how to make normal adjustments to their camera. A DSLR (Digital Single Lens Reflex) or mirrorless camera is suggested. One wide angle lens with an f\/2.8 aperture (or faster) is also suggested for the NightScapes (additional suggestions will be given to those who register.)<\/p>\n<p><b>Weather<\/b>: Mid-May offers the perfect temperatures! May and Sept. are the best months to visit the bottom of the canyon. Day temps are usually 85º - 95º, with evening temps between 65º - 75º. April can be a little cold. June, July and August are often over 100º in the day. The canyon walls radiate stored heat into the evening, typically keeping the temperatures above 80º much of the night.<\/p>\n<p>See the&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.westernriver.com\/grand-canyon-rafting-tour#prettyPhoto\/0\/\">Overview\/Video<\/a>&nbsp;and Download the&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.westernriver.com\/downloads\/expedition-guides\/grand_canyon_gc7.pdf\">Brochure<\/a><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a248.e.akamai.net\/secure.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/4\/9\/f\/600_445221663.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>This is one of my few group workshops for 2018: most are&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/intothenightphoto.blogspot.com\/2015\/09\/private-nightscape-photography.html\">private workshops<\/a>&nbsp;(with 2-4 people per workshop) going on that year.<\/p>\n<p><b>Extremely Dark Skies<\/b>: This remote region has some of our Earth's darkest night skies.

Drift lazily, relax, and then savor lunch on a white sand beach. Mighty House Rock Rapid and the Roaring 20's set the pace for the next several days. Relax at the water's edge in camp while your guides prepare a delicious dinner, then fall asleep to the most incredible star show in the world.

Ovaj tim oformljen je u maju 2016. sa ciljem da prave igre za mobilne uređaje, prvenstveno iOS. U samom razvoju igara učestvuje troje ljudi, smešteni na Čukaričkoj padini blizu Ade Ciganlije, gde svi zajedno rade. Ime studija je odabrano zbog toga što su dva od tri člana tima - daltonisti! <br><\/p>\n<p>Prvi uspeh ostvarili su igrom \"Nukleus\", koja je izabrana za featured app na App Store-u u 139 zemalja, uključujući SAD, Kanadu i Australiju. Do sada, igra je sakupila preko 180,000 preuzimanja! <br>Sledeća igra, \"Jump or Stay\", izlazi početkom decembra, u saradnji sa Umbrella games. <br>Igra \"Kiss Hero\", koja je trenutno i dalje u razvoju, donela im je priliku da se predstave na Casual Connect-u u Tel Avivu. <br>Pa i pored svega toga, imaju još prototipa spremnih za razvoj. <br>Momci kažu da ne planiraju uskoro da prestanu sa radom. <br><\/p>\n<p>Zvuči dobro?

Nije loše napomenuti: Ukoliko imate potrebu da objavite nešto na Unity susretu, samo pecnite organizatore (Milana Jerkovića ili Aleksandra Manju) i dogovorićemo se.

Videćete kapiju i rampu sa desne strane, sa recepcijskom kućicom i tu uđite. Na recepciji kažete da idete u ICT Hub.<\/p>\n<p>Linija 66 - Kreće od Vukovog spomenika. Najbolje je da je sačekate na stanici u Ruzveltovoj i idete skroz do kraja jer ona vozi baš do Naučno Tehnološkog Parka.

Ell és el fundador i director del programa del Centre de la Consciència a Croàcia i els països de l'antiga Iugoslàvia, en els què dirigeix l'Escola de la Consciència i la mestria espiritual.<br> <br> Iván ha realitzat conferències inspiradores i profundament transformadores , xerrades, seminaris i tallers en més de 15 països d'Europa, Amèrica del Nord i Àsia. Els seus seminaris sobre la vida plena i feliç en l'abundància, l'amor, la pau i l'harmonia han transformat totalment les vides de centenars de persones i han commogut els cors i les ments de milers de persones.<br> <br> El 2010, un mètode molt eficaç per a l'establiment d’ alliberar-se dels bloquejos emocionals i mentals ha entrat en la consciència d'Iván i ell l’ha estat ensenyant a la gent de tot el món. En una meditació guiada de 30 minuts ALO, que és com ell anomena el seu mètode, i més de 30 minuts de conversa curativa, Iván porta a la gent en un viatge de permetre que la intel·ligència infinita de l'Univers&nbsp; guiï les seves vides, d'alliberar els bloquejos emocionals passats i de lliurar-los al Creador \/ Font. Acaba amb l'ompliment en un mateix amb qualitats positives i la presa de decisions conscients sobre les identitats personals i els drets en aquesta vida.<br> <br> En les seves conferències d’ensenyaments espirituals que estan obertes al públic, de forma regular de dues hores la sessió, Ivan guia als participants a través de la comprensió dels mecanismes de la creació, la comprensió i l'ús de la seva pròpia naturalesa divina i el poder propi,&nbsp; a aprendre a fer servir les lleis de l’ Univers per tal de manifestar les&nbsp; metes en la vida i les missions personals, posant-se en contacte amb la Font de tot, l'elecció d'un estat superior de consciència sempre disponible per a ells, i l'assoliment d'una vida inspirada equilibrada en pau, alegria, amor i abundància. Durant les diferents sessions i tallers s'inicien molts efectes de curació espontània que segueixen durant els dies següents. Una sensació general de pau profunda, d’ autoconfiança, d'autoestima i d’inspiració són els resultats de fins i tot una petita xerrada.<br> <\/b><\/p>\n<br>","mtime":1479121020274,"event_url":"https:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Jardins-de-LLUM-temps-de-consciencia\/events\/235570079\/","yes_rsvp_count":1,"duration":5400000,"payment_required":"0","name":"Satsang amb l' Ivan Bavcevic a Barcelona","id":"235570079","time":1479319200000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","country":"es","city":"Girona","name":"Jardins de LLUM, temps de consciència","group_lon":2.81,"id":18211725,"urlname":"Jardins-de-LLUM-temps-de-consciencia","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/f\/c\/2\/highres_431873186.jpeg","photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/f\/c\/2\/600_431873186.jpeg","photo_id":431873186,"thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/f\/c\/2\/thumb_431873186.jpeg"},"group_lat":41.98},"status":"upcoming"}
